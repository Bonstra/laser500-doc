Subroutines provided by the BASIC ROM

Address	Name		Description
0x000b	CONOUT		Output to console
			Output character in register A to the screen.

0x0013	CONIN		Console input
			Read a character from the keyboard into register A.

0x0023	ROLLOVER	Scan the keyboard matrix and store character code in
			register A.

0x0033	READSC		Read from disk
			Read a sector from the floppy disk unit.
			Inputs:
			- 0x8608: track
			- 0x8609: sector
			- 0x860b: data buffer pointer (256 bytes), where the
			          decoded buffer will be written.
			- 0x860d: primary buffer pointer (342 bytes), used to
			          store a GCR-encoded sector.
			- 0x860f: read table pointer (106 bytes, defaults to
			          0xa196, contents copied from ROM (0x6b2c)
			          on boot). It is the GCR decoding table.
			Outputs:
			- Flag CY is set on error, cleared on success
			- 256 bytes of sector data are copied into the data
			  buffer (0x860b)
			- The current track number (0x860a) is updated.

			Buffer addresses used by ROM:
			0x860b (data) -> 0xa200
			0x860d (prim) -> 0xa000
			0x860f (tabl) -> 0xa196

0x0047	RDBYET		Read a byte from the cassette into register A.

0x004a	WRBYET		Write a byte from register A to the cassette.

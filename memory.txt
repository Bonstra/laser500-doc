0x2	0x08000-0x0a7ff		Expansion ROM
0x2	0x0a800-0x0afff		VLSI memory-mapped I/O
0x2	0x0b000-0x0bfff		?

0x3	0x0c000-0x0ffff		(Laser 350) RAM

0x4	0x10000-0x13fff		(Laser 500/700) RAM

DRAM layout

The VLSI acts as a DRAM memory controller which is transparent to the CPU.
The DRAM space is divided into 3 "ranks", each having its own /CAS line,
controlled independently by the VLSI depending on the DRAM bank where the
memory access needs to take place.
All ranks share common 8-bit data bus, 8-bit address bus, as well common /RAS
and /RAMW signals.

Rank	/CAS line	Size	Banks
1	/CAS1		16KB	3
4	/CAS4		64KB	4, 5, 6, 7
5	/CAS5		64KB	8, 9, a, b

Rank 1 is physically implemented with 2 x 4416 DRAM modules (16K x 4-bit
data).
Ranks 4 & 5 are implemented using 8 x 4164 DRAM modules (64K x 1-bit data).

DRAM refresh

The DRAM modules need to be periodically refreshed in order to retain their
data. The VLSI performs DRAM refresh during the VIDEO cycles.
DRAM refreshing consists in cycling through all the rows and refresh them one
by one. To refresh a single row, the VLSI outputs the row address, asserts
/RAS, then release /RAS without asserting /CAS, like it would have done for a
normal read or write operation.
Since all the DRAM chips share the address bus and the /RAS line, all the
DRAM chips are refreshed at once.
Several datasheets for 4416 and 4164 DRAM ICs indicates that all the 128 rows
must be refreshed at least every 2ms.

RAM expansion

Both Laser 350, 500 and 700 can theoretically be expanded up to 144KB of RAM.
In practice however, some Laser 700 units do not even have the internal RAM
expansion port soldered on the board, which limits them to the built-in
128KB.

The RAM expansion module is composed of DRAM chips organized in a similar
fashion as what is described in the "DRAM layout" section. The DRAM ICs of
course must have compatible timings and internal organization (128 rows).

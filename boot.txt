ROM boot sequence

During boot, the ROM will first look for a valid boot signature in the ROM
expansion space. The signature is the sequence of bytes AA 55 E7 18.
Such sequence will be searched in ROM space at the following physical
addresses, in order:
- 0x08000
- 0x30000
- 0x34000
- 0x38000
- 0x3c000

If the boot signature is found, the ROM jumps at {signature addres + 0x4}.

Next, the ROM looks for the presence of a floppy disk interface.
The ROM writes the value 0x00 in I/O port 0x10 in order to reset a potential
FDC.
Then, the ROM writes the value 0xaa to port 0x13 (FDC data buffer) and
reads the result back.
If the values are identical, a second test is attempted with value 0x40. If it
succeeds too, the disk controller interface is present.
If the FDC is present, the ROM loads 256 bytes from sector 0 of track 0 into
memory and runs it.
